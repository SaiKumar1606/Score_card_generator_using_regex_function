We're hearing there were thundershowers in Canberra yesterday, but today has dawned bright and dry. There's just under half an hour to go for the toss, so it's a good time to have a quick glance at our preview.

1.40pm Afternoon, everyone. India came into this tour having won three of their last four ODIs against Australia in Australia, but this tour has reminded them of exactly how difficult a country this is to visit. Australia have already wrapped up the ODI series, and 3-0 is very much on the cards if India can't find a way to add some teeth to their bowling, especially since conditions at the Manuka Oval are expected to be as batting-friendly as - if not more than - they were at the SCG. This might be a dead rubber, but there's still plenty to play for, so strap in and stay with us through the ride.

SYED IBRAHIM: "I would love to see Siraj playing in place of Saini. Also there has to be an additional batsman. Anyhow it's gonna be a run fiest." -- Siraj isn't part of the ODI squad, officially, but neither was Bumrah before he made his debut in 2016, so you never know...

Gavin Bruhn: "They are playing a full-strength Australian team this time." -- India weren't at full strength in 2018-19 either. They rested Bumrah for the ODI series and didn't have Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul, who was suspended.

Amar: "India has recently failed to give reserves an opportunity in such dead rubbers hope it's not the case today. Make as many changes as possible cuz nothing can replace intl experience."

Saleque Sufi: "Flat wicket , toss will matter . Toss and bat can make team winning score around 370 -380. I would suggest playing Cameroon Green letting Labuschagne open with Finch." -- From Finch's pre-match quotes, it seems like Australia might not want to upset their middle-order combination.

Karen: "As a Canberran (very jealous of anyone going as I have to work), I can tell you, there's a great chance of a 400+ total if Australia bats first today. Great weather conditions, light cloud, warm, light breeze...but watch out for the moths later!"

India could make some changes today too. There are a few debates floating around their bowling attack. Gautam Gambhir wants them to play Shardul Thakur and leave Navdeep Saini out for the rest of the white-ball leg of the tour. There's also the question of whether Kuldeep Yadav comes in for Yuzvendra Chahal. What do you think?

1.50pm Cameron Green is set for an ODI debut. He's just received his cap. Mitchell Starc, meanwhile, looks set to miss out. We're hearing whispers of a back/side issue.

Savad: "Even though Mayank's performance wasn't that bad, India should replace him with Pandey/Gill letting Rahul/Gill to pen with Dhawan. Some times staying at crease will have more impact than quick fire 25-35 odd runs."

Saleque Sufi: "India is missing Rohit , a competent third seamer and Dhoni like finisher . Three positions matter in the fight among top dogs."

Mustafa Moudi : "India has lost their last 7 International Games on a bounce. Havent recently seen the Indian Team in a Situation worse than . Anything can happen in 2020 !!"

Karen: "Oh, and those weren't thundershowers. It was more like a thunder-rain-slap. I was driving and my car was being pushed around by the wind. Crazy hour!"

Sarthak: "Daniel Sams/Ashton Agar are a perfect replacement for Starc while Sean Abott is a perfect replacement for Cummins. Very Strong Australia, having alternatives for all players!! Matthew Wade can also come in for Alex Carey too." -- Not having Cummins + Starc will definitely test Australia, especially if conditions are as batting-friendly as we expect.

Some pictures of the pitch coming in too - a few cracks around, but they're widely spaced-out, and it looks like they'll need to open up a lot more (it probably won't happen over the course of 100 overs) to have a major impact.

2.05pm Steven Smith presented Cam Green his ODI cap. Big moment for the young batting allrounder. It also looks like T Natarajan has got his ODI cap. Wow. What a ride it has been for the left-arm quick.

Both teams have added depth to their batting - Australia in particular, with Agar and Abbott at 8 and 9. I feel for Agarwal, who made bright starts in both games, and might have deserved another chance to show he can get in and bat big.

Three changes for Australia. Back niggle for Starc, Aaron Finch says. Green, Abbott and Ashton Agar are in for Warner, Cummins and Starc. "Myself and Marnus will be opening."

India have really rung in the changes. Apart from Natarajan, Shubman Gill, Shardul Thakur and Kuldeep Yadav have also come into the side. Mayank Agarwal, Navdeep Saini, Mohammed Shami and Yuzvendra Chahal sit out.

2.10pm Well, well. India have won a toss! They'll bat first. "Looks like a really, really good wicket to bat on," says Virat Kohli. He says India "haven't tried enough things with the ball" so far in the series.

Dhaval : "I am not in favor of giving reserves an opportunity for and judge them just for 1 match. If you really want to test a player, you have to give them a longer run. I feel Natarajan should have been our third seamer in all the matches and T20s as well. He has good death bowling skills which could have allowed to use Bumrah early."

Balasubramanian: "From Chinnappampatti to Canberra Natarajan story is really inspiring. "

Varun: "Gill won't get any better opportunity than this..opening the innings in a batting paradise..no Cummins and Starc in opposition..no pressure to score af faster pace since dhawan is there at the other end to provide aggressive starts..hope gill will realise all the potentials into results today.."

Shikhar Dhawan: "We have been batting well. We just have to convert those 30s and 40s into big ones. Very happy with my batting form, enjoying timing the ball well. Wickets have been good to bat on."

Megh: "I feel for Saini. I felt his spells were improving and was in the cusp of a breakthrough. Understand they needed to try out Natarajan, but that could happen by resting Bumrah"

Khan: "I strongly feel Agarwal and shami are rested rather than dropped. They are both important for four Test matches. You can argue about Bumrah but one of Shami and Bumrah has to play today to lead the pack."

Pugal: "Feel bad for Manish Pandey. Played so well when India toured Australia last time. This is what happens when you are not flexible in your batting position. Lose your batting position first and eventually dropped from the team."

Cameron: "Out of the four players after Jadeja, can any of them bat?" - Shardul Thakur is a pretty good No. 8. Kuldeep Yadav has a first-class hundred, but I'm not sure he has the power game for white-ball cricket.

2.30pm So much to look forward to today. Debutants and plenty of other newish faces, bright sunshine, and I'm sure 100 enthralling overs. Alex Malcolm will bring you the opening exchanges as I go and get myself a snack.

vaibhav goyal: "I feel for Agarwal.He has a proven domestic and india A record. Some people are given long runs and other are deprived of confidence by too much chopping. Work in his temperament and innings approach rather."

Akhilesh: "In India's long ODI history, T Natarajan is just the 11th left-arm seamer!"

Bails: "Fascinated to see if Green gets the new ball for Aus ahead of Abbott. Unlikely to bowl his full 10 either way." I think it will be Abbott and Hazlewood first up Bails but you never know.

2.35pm Thank Karthik. Exciting to see a few new faces today on both sides.

Given lbw! Gill takes his time but he finally reviews. Gill tried to sweep a delivery that pitched on off and slid on, it hit the front pad a fair way down and the umpire gave it out. Nothing on hot spot or RTS in terms of bat involved. Ball tracking says hitting in line and hitting the bails! It's umpire's call. Decision stands but India keep their two reviews

Gone! Iyer was looking to force the pace there, trying to reverse some of the momentum Australia have built with these quiet overs. Full and quickish, on the stumps, and Iyer looks to make room to drive through - or maybe over - the covers. Ends up a little more leg-side of the ball than he wants, and the ball turns and he slices it into backward point's hands

Agar to Rahul, OUT
Gone, that's not a good shot at all. It's quite full, it's on the stumps, and it's hugely risky to try and sweep those balls. This one passes under his bat, and he's been given out lbw. He's reviewed... Only bounce can save him, I think. No bat on it. Big stride forward, so that might help. Nope. It's hitting the top part of middle stump, so he'll have to be on his way. India lose a review too. Really poor choice of shot, I think

KL Rahul lbw b Agar 5 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.45
Shon: "This is too old school batting against the spinners. Look at the teams like Eng and Aus. They attack spinners from the beginning using sweeps, reverse-sweeps, switch-hits and stepping out. India need to seriously think about their strategy to play spin in the modern day cricket."

This comment came in just before the dismissal. There's some merit to this - India's batsmen don't sweep or reverse-sweep as much as some other teams do - but Rahul just chose the wrong ball for it:

Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT
Ooh, Australia have reviewed for a caught-behind! Back of a length, straightening just a touch in the corridor. Kohli is looking initially to work this with the angle, I think, and then he's adjusting to the movement when the ball zips past his outside edge. Or has it kissed his edge? There's the tiniest of spikes on Ultra-Edge, but it's enough of a spike to reverse the on-field decision and send Kohli back. What a massive strike from Hazlewood!

Rahul Oak: "I'm trying really hard to not over-react to this series, given COVID disruptions, but India's approach to ODIs seems a bit outdated, without a doubt. The new-age way to approach ODIs seems to be to treat it like a longer version of a T20 game, but unfortunately, India don't have the all-rounders to allow the top and middle order to play with freedom. Hard to see this changing in a hurry unless India can unearth a few all-rounders ina hurry."

Eric: "After the IPL my mouth was watering at the prospect of Hardik and Jadeja finishing an innings together and they have not disappointed. Seriously impressed with Pandya at number 6, he must bat in the top 5 in the T20Is."

Hardik Pandya on the flying mic: "We were expecting to score 260-270 but we always say when you try to score 60-70 you can end up getting 90. We kept our plans pretty simple and aimed for 60-65 and because of the shots we have we were able to get the extra 20-25." He got asked if he would bowl again today, he said "that's not going to happen" with a smile.
